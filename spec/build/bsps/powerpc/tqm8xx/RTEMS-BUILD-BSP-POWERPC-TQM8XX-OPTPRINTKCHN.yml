  (BSP--console driver) Must be defined to be one of CONS_CHN_SMC1, CONS_CHN_SMC2, CONS_CHN_SCC2, CONS_CHN_SCC3, or CONS_CHN_SCC4. Determines which device is used for output by printk(). If the port that printk() uses is also used for other I/O (e.g. if  PRINTK_CHN == CONSOLE_CHN), then both ports should use the same type of I/O, otherwise the drivers will likely conflict with each other.
