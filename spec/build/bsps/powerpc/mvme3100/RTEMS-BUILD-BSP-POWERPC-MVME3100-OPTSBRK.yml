  If defined then the BSP may reduce the available memory size initially. This can be useful for debugging (reduce the core size) or dynamic loading (std gcc text offsets/jumps are < +/-32M).  Note that the policy can still be defined by the application (see sbrk.c, BSP_sbrk_policy). By undefining CONFIGURE_MALLOC_BSP_SUPPORTS_SBRK this feature is removed and a little memory is saved.
